### What I learned

I learned that the use of good accessibility practices in HTML is increasingly fundamental in font end development. A large part of the content present on the internet can become accessible only with the correct use of HTML elements. For example, multimedia content - image/video cannot be seen by people with visual impairments, as well as audio content cannot be heard by people with hearing impairment.
In the project I learned the importance of the "alt" feature to provide screen readers with the representation of the image that will be used.

```html
<img src="" alt="description of img tag content representation">
```

In css, I was able to learn techniques for centering elements on the screen using flexbox. But its use goes further and is efficient to create layouts, distribute spaces between items in a container, even when the dimensions of these items are unknown or dynamic.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```
